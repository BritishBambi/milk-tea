                        <p class="mb-0">As you can see here there is a range of different tea colours the country ends up choosing from.
                            However, this opens up to a lot of colours that are simply not allowed. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-4">
                        <h3>D4</h3>
                        <p>Lets start with D4. An serious crime against tea. This should only ever happen on accident. Either you were hungover and not
                            paying attention or someone knocked your pouring hand. Either way, this is not allowed.
                        </p>
                            <h3>A1</h3>
                        <p>On the other side of the spectrum we have A1. You would think this plays by similar rules but in actual fact it is perfectly valid.
                            Not everyone can drink milk, and herbal teas are a thing. If you're complaining its probably because you use too much milk
                        </p>
                        <h3> C2-D2</h3>
                        <p>Ahhh there we go, looking a lot better. This is what most of the country says their tea colour looks like. Aiming for this 
                            is a good balance of milk and tea. If you're not happy with this colour, you're probably just being picky.
                        </p>
                        <h3> B1</h3>
                        <p>I'm going to assume someone threw a single splash of milk at you from across the room because what's even the point here.
                        </p>
                        <h3>D3</h3>
                        <p>This is not a tea colour, this is a milk colour. Either settle down that pouring arm or actually let the tea bag stay in the cup for more than 5 seconds</p>
